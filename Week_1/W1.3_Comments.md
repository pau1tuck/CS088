# Comments

Learn about how to create documentation within a C++ program.

Comments are notes left by the programmer that describes C++ code in plain English.

Since comments are ignored by the compiler, they can also be used to prevent code execution (“comment out code”).

In this article, we’ll take a look at the two types of comments in C++.

## Single-line Comments

Single-line comments are created using two consecutive forward slashes. The compiler ignores any text after `//` on the same line. For example:

```cpp
// Prints: Codecademy rocks!
std::cout << "Codecademy rocks!";
```

Style tip: Single-line comments are often placed above the code they are commenting on.

You may also place a single-line comment to the right of a statement, but be careful not to exceed the 80 character length limit.

Multi-line Comments
Multi-line comments begin with `/*` and end with `*/`. The compiler ignores any text in between. For example:

```cpp
/*
The function below takes
in two integers and returns
their product.
*/
int multiply(int a, int b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

**Style tip**: Multi-line comments always go above the code they are commenting about. To make multi-line comments more readable, keep each line at the same indentation level.
