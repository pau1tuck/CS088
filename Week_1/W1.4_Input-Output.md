# Input and Output

In the Hello World example, we briefly mentioned that std::cout is used to output text to the terminal. In this article, we will learn more about input and output in C++.

## Input/Output Library

`iostream`, which stands for “input-output stream”, is part of the C++ standard library that deals with basic input and output. To use the functionality defined within the library, we need to include the `iostream` header at the beginning of our program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

## C++ Output

`std::cout`, which stands for “character output”, is used together with the insertion operator `<<` to print values in the terminal:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello World!";
```

The above code will print:

`Hello World!`

Multiple insertion operators can be used together on the same line:

```cpp
std::cout << "The Department of Computer Science is at number " << 67 << " Wolfson Road.";
```

The above code will print:

`The Department of Computer Science is at number 67 Wolfson Road.`

**Note**: `std::cout` does NOT automatically insert a new line at the end of the line.

## New Lines

A new line can be inserted by adding `\n` in the text to be printed. The `\n` will not show up in the output because it is an escape sequence.

For example:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!\n";
std::cout << "C++ is fun!\n";
```

The above code will print:

```md
Hello World!
C++ is fun!
```

`std::endl`, which stands for “end line”, can also be used to achieve the same result:

```cpp
std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
std::cout << "C++ is fun!" << std::endl;
```

The usage of \n and std::endl are mostly interchangeable for our purpose.
