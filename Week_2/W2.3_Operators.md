# Operators

Learn how to use operators in C++.

In C++, operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. In an operation, symbols are labeled as either operands or operators.

```cpp
int n = 3 + 4;
```

In the example above, _n_, _3_, and _4_ are the operands, while `=` and `+` are the operators.

This article will cover the most commonly used operators and operator precedence in C++.

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numerical variables such as `int` and `double`.

- `+` Addition: `x + y` (x plus y)

- `-` Subtraction: `x - y` (x minus y)

- `*` Multiplication: `x * y` (x multiplied by y)

- `/` Division: `x / y` (x divided by y)

- `%` Modulus: `x % y` (the remainder of x divided by y)

- `++_` Pre-increment: `++x` (increment x, then return x)

- `--_` Pre-decrement: `--x` (decrement x, then return x)

- `_++` Post-increment: `x++` (copy x, increment x, then return the copy)

- `_--` Post-decrement: `x--` (copy x, then decrement x, then return the copy)

Example of arithmetic operators in action:

```cpp
int x = 4, y = 2;
int z = x + y;      // z now equals 6
z = x / y;          // z now equals 2
z = x % y;          // z now equals 0
z = --x;            // z now equals 3, x now equals 3
```

### _Pre_- vs. _Post_- Increment

As shown above, the increment and decrement operators each have a pre- version and a post- version. Although they look similar, the two versions have different meanings.

When placed before the operand, they are called _pre-increment_ and _pre-decrement_ operators. The value stored in the operand is incremented or decremented first, and then that operand is returned. For example:

```cpp
int x = 10;

// x is decremented to 9 first, and then assigned to y
int y = --x;        // pre-increment

std::cout << x << ' ' << y;
```

The above code will output:
`9 9`

When placed after the operand, they are called _post-increment_ and _post-decrement_ operators.

Postfix operators require more steps than prefix operators. First, a copy of the operand is made. Then, the operand (not the copy) is incremented or decremented. Finally, the copy (not the original) is evaluated. For example:

```cpp
int x = 10;

// A copy of x is made first, then x is decremented to 9
// Finally the value of the copy (10) is assigned to y
int y = x--;

std::cout << x << ' ' << y;
```

The above code will output:
`9 10`

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Furthermore, compound assignment operators can perform arithmetic operations on a variable and reassign its value in one step. They can be thought of as short-hand operators.

```cpp
x = 5       // assign 5 to x
x += 5      // add 5 to existing value of x
x -= 5      // subtract 5 from existing value of x
x *= 5      // multiply existing value of x by 5
x /= 5      // divide existing value of x by 5
x %= 5      // divide existing value of x by 5 and give the remainder
```

For example, the following statements...

```cpp
x = x + 5;
y = y * 2;
```

...may be substituted with compound assignments:

```cpp
x += 5;
y *= 2;
```

## Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare two variables or values. The result of the operation of a relational operator is a `bool` (`true` or `false`).

There are six relational operators in C++:

```cpp
x == y      // is x equal to y?
x != y      // is x not equal to y?
x > y       // is x greater than y?
x < y       // is x less than y?
x >= y      // is x greater than or equal to y?
x <= y      // is x less than or equal to y?
```

Example of relational operators in action:

```cpp
int x = 7;
bool a = x > 5;  // a is 1 (true) because 7 is greater than 5
bool b = x < 4;  // a is 0 (false) because 7 is NOT less than 4
```

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine the logic of two or more conditions. The result of a logical operation is a `bool` (`true` or `false`).

```cpp
//   && (logical AND)
x && y      // true if both x and y are true, false otherwise

//   || (logical OR)
x || y      // true if either x or y are true, false otherwise

//   ! (logical NOT)
!x          // true if x is false, or false if x is true
```

Example of logical operators in action:

```cpp
bool x = true, y = false;
bool z = x && y;    // z equals false because "true AND false" is false
z = x || y;         // z equals true because "true OR false" is true
z = !x;             // z equals false because "NOT true" is false
```

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators are used to manipulate variables at the bit level. They are most commonly used with numerical variables to perform bit operations.

There are 6 bitwise operators in C++:

| Operator | Name        | Example | Description                     |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------------------------------|
| <<       | Left shift  | x << y  | shift bits in x left by y       |
| >>       | Right shift | x >> y  | shift bits in x right by y      |
| ~        | bitwise NOT | ~x      | flip all bits in x              |
| &        | bitwise AND | x & y   | each bit in x AND each bit in y |
| \|       | bitwise OR  | x \| y  | each bit in x OR each bit in y  |
| ^        | bitwise XOR | x ^ y   | each bit in x XOR each bit in y |

Here's an xample of bitwise operators in action:

```cpp
int x = 3;          // in bits: 0011
int y = 9;          // in bits: 1001

int z = x << 2;     // z equals 12, in bits: 1100
z = y >> 1;         // z equals 4, in bits: 0100
z = x | y;          // z equals 11, in bits: 1011
```

## Operator Precedence

When operators are used in simple expressions such as x = 2 + 3, there is no confusion about which operation will be evaluated first. However, things get more complicated when multiple operators appear in the same expression. For example, what is the value of y after this assignment?

```cpp
int y = 4 + 2 * (6 / 3)    // y equals ___
```

Operator precedence helps programmers answer questions like this. Just like in mathematics, all operators in C++ are assigned a level of precedence. In a compound expression, operators are evaluated in the order of their precedence level in descending order (smallest precedence value go first).

1. `()` has the highest precedence here, so the value within the parenthesis will be evaluated first.
2. `/` will be evaluated next because it is the only operator within the parenthesis. The expression now simplifies to `int y = 4 + 2 * 2`
3. `-` has the second-highest precedence. The expression now simplifies to `int y = 4 + 4`
4. `+` has the third-highest precedence. The expression now simplifies to `int y = 8`
5. `=` has the lowest precedence. At this point, the value `8` has been assigned to the variable `int y`.
