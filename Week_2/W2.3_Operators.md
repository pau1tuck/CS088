# Operators

Learn how to use operators in C++.

In C++, operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. In an operation, symbols are labeled as either operands or operators.

```cpp
int n = 3 + 4;
```

In the example above, _n_, _3_, and _4_ are the operands, while `=` and `+` are the operators.

This article will cover the most commonly used operators and operator precedence in C++.

## Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numerical variables such as `int` and `double`.

- `+` Addition: `x + y` (x plus y)

- `-` Subtraction: `x - y` (x minus y)

- `*` Multiplication: `x * y` (x multiplied by y)

- `/` Division: `x / y` (x divided by y)

- `%` Modulus: `x % y` (the remainder of x divided by y)

- `++_` Pre-increment: `++x` (increment x, then return x)

- `--_` Pre-decrement: `--x` (decrement x, then return x)

- `_++` Post-increment: `x++` (copy x, increment x, then return the copy)

- `_--` Post-decrement: `x--` (copy x, then decrement x, then return the copy)

Example of arithmetic operators in action:

```cpp
int x = 4, y = 2;
int z = x + y;      // z now equals 6
z = x / y;          // z now equals 2
z = x % y;          // z now equals 0
z = --x;            // z now equals 3, x now equals 3
```

### _Pre_- vs. _Post_- Increment

As shown above, the increment and decrement operators each have a pre- version and a post- version. Although they look similar, the two versions have different meanings.

When placed before the operand, they are called _pre-increment_ and _pre-decrement_ operators. The value stored in the operand is incremented or decremented first, and then that operand is returned. For example:

```cpp
int x = 10;

// x is decremented to 9 first, and then assigned to y
int y = --x;        // pre-increment

std::cout << x << ' ' << y;
```

The above code will output:
`9 9`

When placed after the operand, they are called _post-increment_ and _post-decrement_ operators.

Postfix operators require more steps than prefix operators. First, a copy of the operand is made. Then, the operand (not the copy) is incremented or decremented. Finally, the copy (not the original) is evaluated. For example:

```cpp
int x = 10;

// A copy of x is made first, then x is decremented to 9
// Finally the value of the copy (10) is assigned to y
int y = x--;

std::cout << x << ' ' << y;
```

The above code will output:
`9 10`

## Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. Furthermore, compound assignment operators can perform arithmetic operations on a variable and reassign its value in one step. They can be thought of as short-hand operators.

```cpp
x = 5       // assign 5 to x
x += 5      // add 5 to existing value of x
x -= 5      // subtract 5 from existing value of x
x *= 5      // multiply existing value of x by 5
x /= 5      // divide existing value of x by 5
x %= 5      // divide existing value of x by 5 and give the remainder
```

For example, the following statements...

```cpp
x = x + 5;
y = y * 2;
```

...may be substituted with compound assignments:

```cpp
x += 5;
y *= 2;
```

## Relational Operators

Relational operators are used to compare two variables or values. The result of the operation of a relational operator is a `bool` (`true` or `false`).

There are six relational operators in C++:

```cpp
x == y      // is x equal to y?
x != y      // is x not equal to y?
x > y       // is x greater than y?
x < y       // is x less than y?
x >= y      // is x greater than or equal to y?
x <= y      // is x less than or equal to y?
```

Example of relational operators in action:

```cpp
int x = 7;
bool a = x > 5;  // a is 1 (true) because 7 is greater than 5
bool b = x < 4;  // a is 0 (false) because 7 is NOT less than 4
```

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine the logic of two or more conditions. The result of a logical operation is a `bool` (`true` or `false`).

```cpp
//   && (logical AND)
x && y      // true if both x and y are true, false otherwise

//   || (logical OR)
x || y      // true if either x or y are true, false otherwise

//   ! (logical NOT)
!x          // true if x is false, or false if x is true
```

Example of logical operators in action:

```cpp
bool x = true, y = false;
bool z = x && y;    // z equals false because "true AND false" is false
z = x || y;         // z equals true because "true OR false" is true
z = !x;             // z equals false because "NOT true" is false
```

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators are used to manipulate variables at the bit level. They are most commonly used with numerical variables to perform bit operations.

There are 6 bitwise operators in C++:

| Operator | Name        | Example | Description                     |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------------------------------|
| <<       | Left shift  | x << y  | shift bits in x left by y       |
| >>       | Right shift | x >> y  | shift bits in x right by y      |
| ~        | bitwise NOT | ~x      | flip all bits in x              |
| &        | bitwise AND | x & y   | each bit in x AND each bit in y |
| \|       | bitwise OR  | x \| y  | each bit in x OR each bit in y  |
| ^        | bitwise XOR | x ^ y   | each bit in x XOR each bit in y |
