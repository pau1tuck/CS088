# Reference and Pointers

Learn how to manipulate memory in C++.

When a variable is declared, a free memory address is set aside for the purpose of storing the value inside that variable. C++ provides two powerful features that allow programmers to directly manipulate memory:

- References
- Pointers

Memory manipulation has many use cases in C++. For example, it is used for dynamic memory allocation and advanced data structures such as linked lists and trees.

## References

In C++, a reference variable is an alias to an existing variable. It is declared by using an ampersand & between the reference type and the variable name: [AS A SUFFIX OF THE REFERENCE TYPE]

```cpp
int exam_grade = 85;
int& score = exam_grade;
```

The score variable is an alias to the exam_grade variable. When the value of score is changed, the value of exam_grade will also change in the same way.

Be careful about two things when declaring a reference variable:

- References must be initialized: there is no such thing as an empty reference.
- References cannot be reassigned: reassigning an existing reference variable will produce unexpected results.

```cpp
double& volume;    // Compiler error, reference not initialized.

int x = 1, y = 2;
int& num = x;
num = y;    // Reassigning references will result in undesired behavior!
```

The primary application for references in C++ is in function parameters. Because the reference parameter acts as an alias for the argument, a function that uses a reference parameter is able to modify the argument passed in.
